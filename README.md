    twp: String variable, Township
    addr: String variable, Address
    e: String variable, Dummy variable (always 1)

Just go along with this notebook and try to complete the instructions or answer the questions in bold using your Python and Data Science skills!


Finance Data Project

In this data project we will focus on exploratory data analysis of stock prices. Keep in mind, this project is just meant to practice your visualization and pandas skills, it is not meant to be a robust financial analysis or be taken as financial advice.

NOTE: This project is extremely challenging because it will introduce a lot of new concepts and have you looking things up on your own (we'll point you in the right direction) to try to solve the tasks issued. Feel free to just go through the solutions lecture notebook and video as a "walkthrough" project if you don't want to have to look things up yourself. You'll still learn a lot that way!

We'll focus on bank stocks and see how they progressed throughout the financial crisis all the way to early 2016.
Get the Data

In this section we will learn how to use pandas to directly read data from Google finance using pandas!

First we need to start with the proper imports, which we've already laid out for you here.

Note: You'll need to install pandas-datareader for this to work! Pandas datareader allows you to read stock information directly from the internet Use these links for install guidance (pip install pandas-datareader), or just follow along with the video lecture.
